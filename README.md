The name Bifrost (pronounced Biv-rost) comes from the old Norse mythology and is the name for the bridge that connects the world of man with the world of the gods. In the same manner this project aims to connect the outside of secure compute infrastructures in the Nordics, with the insides of these secure compute infrastructures.
